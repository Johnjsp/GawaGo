# GawaGo API Reference

This document describes the current REST API used by the web client and intended future mobile clients.

## Base URL

Local development:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Production clients should use the deployed HTTPS origin.

## Conventions

- Request and response bodies are JSON unless an endpoint explicitly accepts file uploads.
- Authenticated requests use a bearer token returned by `POST /api/accounts/login/`.
- Send the token as:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access>
```

- Timestamps are ISO 8601 strings.
- Decimal values such as rates, latitude, and longitude may be returned as strings by Django REST Framework.
- Common error shape:

```json
{
  "detail": "Human-readable error message."
}
```

## Roles

- `household`: can create job postings, review applicants, hire workers, complete/cancel owned jobs, and review workers after completed jobs.
- `worker`: can apply to jobs, submit verification requests, and review households after completed jobs.
- `admin`: Django staff/superuser account. Can access admin-only analytics and approve/reject verification requests.

## Public System Endpoints

## Accounts

### Register

`POST /api/accounts/register/`

- `min_rate`
- `max_rate`

Example:

```text
GET /api/jobs/?status=open&required_skill=cleaning&location=Tayabas
```

### Create Job

`POST /api/jobs/`

Auth: Bearer required, household only.

Accepts JSON or multipart form data. Multipart field `images` accepts up to 5 images, each JPG, PNG, or WebP and up to 5 MB.

```json
{
  "title": "Weekend house cleaning",
  "job_type": "Domestic Helper",
  "required_skill": "cleaning",
  "schedule_type": "Weekend",
  "preferred_date": "2026-06-01",

  "longitude": "121.5920000",
  "service_rate": "800.00",
  "worker_slots": 1
}
```

Either `schedule` or both `preferred_date` and `preferred_time` are required. New jobs must start as `open`.

### Job Detail

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/jobs/{id}/` | Public | Returns one job with applications and images. |
| PATCH | `/api/jobs/{id}/` | Bearer required, job owner or staff | Updates a job. |
| PUT | `/api/jobs/{id}/` | Bearer required, job owner or staff | Replaces a job. |
| DELETE | `/api/jobs/{id}/` | Bearer required, job owner or staff | Deletes a job. |

Allowed job status transitions:

- `open` to `open` or `cancelled`
- `assigned` to `assigned`, `completed`, or `cancelled`
- `completed` stays `completed`
- `cancelled` stays `cancelled`

A job can be completed only when it has at least one hired worker. Completion also updates related application/review workflow through backend services.

### Apply To Job

`POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/apply/`

Auth: Bearer required, worker only.

```json
{
  "note": "I am available at the requested time."
}
```

Response `201` returns the created application.

### Update Application Status

`PATCH /api/jobs/applications/{id}/status/`

Auth: Bearer required, job owner or staff.

```json
{
  "status": "hired"
}
```

Allowed requested statuses are `hired` and `rejected`.

Hiring a worker moves the job to `assigned`. When all worker slots are filled, other pending applications are closed.

## Smart Matching

`GET /api/matching/recommended-workers/?job_id=12`

`POST /api/matching/recommended-workers/`

Auth: Bearer required, job owner or staff only.

POST body:

```json
{
  "job_id": 12
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "job_id": 12,
  "job_title": "Weekend house cleaning",
  "required_skill": "cleaning",
  "results": [
    {
      "worker_id": 7,
      "worker_username": "juan",
      "skills": ["cleaning", "laundry"],
      "matches_skill": true,
      "verification_status": "verified",
      "distance_km": 2.4,
      "distance_label": "2.4 km away",
      "match_score": 92.5,
      "rating_label": "4.80",
      "rating_score": 4.8,
      "available_at_requested_time": true,
      "rate_score": 1.0,
      "worker_rate": "800.00 daily"
    }
  ]
}
```

Matching is advisory. Households still choose the final worker.

## Reviews

### List Reviews

`GET /api/reviews/`

Auth: Public

Query options:

- `username` or `target_username`: reviews received by a user.
- `author_username`: reviews written by a user.

If no query parameter is provided, authenticated users receive reviews targeting themselves. Anonymous requests without a username return `400`.

Worker-to-household feedback is anonymous in API responses. For anonymous worker feedback, `author` is `null`, `author_username` is empty, and `author_name` is `Anonymous worker`. Public `author_username` queries do not expose worker-authored anonymous feedback.

### Create Review

`POST /api/reviews/`

Auth: Bearer required.

```json
{
  "target_username": "juan",
  "job_id": 12,
  "job_title": "Weekend house cleaning",
  "rating": "5.0",
  "feedback": "Arrived on time and completed the work well."
}
```

Rules:

- Reviews are only allowed between households and workers.
- Reviews require a completed job relationship.
- Households may rate workers from `1.0` to `5.0`.
- Workers may submit feedback for households, but cannot assign a numeric rating.
- A household can review the same worker only once per completed job.

## Notifications

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/notifications/` | Bearer required | Lists current user's notifications. |
| PATCH | `/api/notifications/{id}/read/` | Bearer required | Marks one notification as read. |

Notification types:

- `application`
- `account_activity`
- `accepted`
- `hiring`
- `rejection`
- `verification`
- `analytics`
- `completion`
- `review_reminder`

Notification object:

```json
{
  "id": 30,
  "recipient": 7,
  "recipient_username": "juan",
  "notification_type": "accepted",
  "title": "Application accepted",
  "message": "Your application for Weekend house cleaning was accepted.",
  "is_read": false,
  "created_at": "2026-05-26T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Verification Requests

### List Verification Requests

`GET /api/common/verification-requests/`

Auth: Bearer required.

Staff users receive all verification requests ordered by latest submission. Worker users receive only their own requests. Household users are rejected with `403`.

### Submit Verification Request

`POST /api/common/verification-requests/`

Auth: Bearer required, worker only.

```json
{
  "primary_id_name": "National ID",
  "secondary_doc_name": "Barangay clearance",
  "primary_id_file": "<file>",
  "secondary_doc_file": "<file>",
  "notes": "Available for admin review."
}
```

If the worker already has a non-rejected request, it is updated and reset to `pending`.

Verification document uploads accept JPG, PNG, WebP, or PDF files up to 5 MB each. The API response returns protected document URLs in `primary_id_preview` and `secondary_doc_preview`; these URLs require bearer authentication and are only available to the worker owner or staff users.

### Verification Documents

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/common/verification-requests/{id}/documents/primary/` | Bearer required, request owner or staff only | Streams the submitted primary ID file. |
| GET | `/api/common/verification-requests/{id}/documents/secondary/` | Bearer required, request owner or staff only | Streams the submitted supporting document file. |

### Verification Request Detail

`GET /api/common/verification-requests/{id}/`

Auth: Bearer required, request owner or staff only.

Returns `verification_request` and associated `worker`.

### Review Verification Request

`POST /api/common/verification-requests/{id}/review/`

Auth: Staff/admin required.

Approve:

```json
{
  "action": "approve"
}
```

Reject:

```json
{
  "action": "reject",
  "review_note": "Document is unreadable."
}
```

Approval sets the worker profile `verification_status` to `verified`. Rejection sets it to `rejected`.

## Analytics

`GET /api/analytics/dashboard-metrics/`

Auth: Staff/admin required.

Response:

```json
{
  "open_jobs": 10,
  "verified_workers": 6,
  "completed_jobs": 18,
  "cancelled_jobs": 2,
  "active_applications": 14,
  "total_accounts": 42,
  "avg_rating": 4.7,
  "analytics": {}
}
```

The nested `analytics` object contains dashboard summaries such as job activity, verification/trust metrics, geographic distribution, and service rate transparency data.

## Mobile Client Notes

- Store the bearer token securely using platform secure storage.
- Refresh/login again when an API call returns token-expired authentication errors.
- Use multipart form data for profile photos, job images, and verification documents.
- Treat matching order and `match_score` as recommendation data only; final hiring choice remains user-controlled.
- Use `display_rating` for new users because unrated users are intentionally shown as `No ratings yet`.
